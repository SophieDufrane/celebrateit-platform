## 1. Project Overview

### Brief Description

[CelebrateIt](https://celebrateit-866641373084.herokuapp.com/) is a mock employee recognition platform inspired by the solutions offered by [Workhuman](https://www.workhuman.com). It allows employees to share recognition stories, nominate colleagues for their achievements, and engage with content through likes and comments. By fostering a sense of appreciation and collaboration, CelebrateIt mirrors the functionality and purpose of modern social recognition platforms.

The project was built with the goal of designing a full-stack, token-authenticated web application using Django REST (backend) and React (frontend). It serves as a learning and portfolio project to demonstrate key development skills, including CRUD operations, component-based design, RESTful API integration, and deployment to Heroku.

### Target Audience

CelebrateIt is designed for:

- **Employees**: To feel valued and connected by sharing their achievements and recognizing contributions from their colleagues.

- **HR Teams**: To track and analyze recognition trends, fostering a more engaged workforce while identifying top performers and recognizing outstanding contributions.

- **Team Leaders and Managers**: To build a positive team culture by facilitating recognition and appreciation among their team.

- **Companies**: That wish to improve employee satisfaction and retention by integrating a sense of community into their workplace culture.

#### UX Design Principles

User experience was prioritized by keeping the interface clean, predictable, and intuitive. The dual-feed layout, clear form feedback, dropdown menus, and use of color were guided by accessibility and usability best practices. The decision to split recognitions and nominations into distinct components also stems from a UX-first mindset: each content type needed to be readable, skimmable, and visually distinct.

### 2.2 Scope

All features listed above are prioritised using the **MoSCoW Framework** to guide development focus and ensure a successful MVP.

The current breakdown is:

- **Must Have** (13 / 21 → 62%): Core functionality required for project success.

- **Should Have** (6 / 21 → 28%): Enhancements that improve usability and experience.

- **Could Have** (2 / 21 → 10%): Nice-to-have features if time allows.

- **Won’t Have**: Explicitly removed from scope.

This distribution ensures alignment with project constraints and focus, while still allowing space for polish and stretch goals where appropriate.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD provides a high-level overview of the database structure, including the relationships between key models such as users, profiles, recognitions, nominations, tags, comments, and likes. It was designed early in the planning phase to ensure consistent field usage and API compatibility.

![ERD](documentation/erd_celebrateit.png)

#### Flowchart for User Navigation

This section provides a visual representation of the user navigation flow within CelebrateIt. The flowchart captures how users interact with the platform, including key actions such as logging in, browsing stories, creating recognition posts, and navigating between profile pages.

![Flowchart](documentation/flowchart_celebrateit.png)

### 2.3 System Architecture

CelebrateIt follows a decoupled architecture, separating the backend and frontend into two distinct layers:

- **Backend**: Built with Django REST Framework (DRF), the backend exposes a RESTful API. It handles authentication, user profiles, nominations, recognitions, comments, likes, tag/category and department logic. The API returns JSON responses that can be consumed by any client.
- **Frontend**: Developed using React, the frontend interacts with the API via `axios`. It handles routing with React Router, manages state locally (with hooks), and presents a dynamic interface to the user.
- **Data Flow**: React fetches data from DRF endpoints and displays it based on the user's interactions. Forms (e.g. create/edit nomination) submit data back to the API to update the database.
- **Authentication**: User sessions and permissions are managed via Django Allauth and token-based headers on the frontend.
- **Media and Hosting**:
  - User-uploaded images are stored on **Cloudinary**
  - Both frontend and backend are deployed via **Heroku** using a single monorepo setup, ensuring a unified deployment pipeline and simplified maintenance.

This architecture supports scalability and flexibility.

## 4. Technologies Used

### 4.1. Backend

The backend API was developed using Django and the Django REST Framework:

- **Django** – Python-based web framework for rapid development and clean architecture.
- **Django REST Framework** – Used to build RESTful APIs consumed by the frontend.
- **Django Allauth** – Manages user registration, login, logout, and authentication endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database hosted on Heroku via automatic provisioning.
- **Cloudinary** – Handles media uploads and delivery, especially for user-submitted images.

### 4.2 Frontend

The frontend of CelebrateIt was built using the following technologies:

- **React** – Core library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **React Router DOM** – Enables dynamic client-side routing and navigation.
- **Axios** – Handles HTTP requests to the Django REST API.
- **Bootstrap** – Provides a responsive layout foundation and base UI components.
- **CSS Modules** – Used for scoped styling of components and to prevent class name collisions.

#### React Hooks & Architecture

CelebrateIt relies heavily on React functional components with hooks for local state and side effects. `useState` manages form inputs, toggle states, and like/comment data. `useEffect` is used for fetching API data and syncing profile updates. The component structure emphasizes separation of concerns: shared layout (`PostLayoutShell`), interaction elements (`PostForm`), and containers provide clarity and reusability across the app.

### 4.3 Deployment & Tools

- **Heroku** – Hosting and deployment of the Django REST API backend.
- **GitHub** – Version control and repository management.
- **GitHub Pages** _(optional)_ – Considered for frontend deployment (not used in final setup).
- **Git** – Local version control with atomic commits and branching.
- **VS Code** – Primary code editor with integrated terminal and extensions for React/Django.
- **Browser-based API testing** – API endpoints were tested directly via browser during development using Django’s built-in dev server.
- **Chrome DevTools & Lighthouse** – Used for inspecting layout, debugging responsiveness, and running accessibility/performance audits.

## 5. Development & Project Planning

### 5.1 Agile methodology

A **Kanban-style** board was implemented using **GitHub Projects** to visually manage tasks, organize development phases, and track progress through user stories and acceptance criteria.

  <summary>Kaban Board</summary>

   <p>
      <img src="documentation/" alt="Kaban Board" />

<details>
  <summary>User Story with Acceptance Criteria and tasks</summary>

   <p>
      <img src="documentation/" alt=">User Story detail" />
   </p>
</details>

### 5.2 Backend Code Structure

The backend is organised into feature-based Django apps:

- `posts/` – Recognition stories with optional image
- `nominations/` – Peer nominations with required tag and nominee selection
- `profiles/` – User profile extensions with department
- `likes/` and `comments/` – Interactions for recognition stories
- `tags/` – Used to categorize nominations
- `department/` – Departments available for user filtering and classification

Each app follows the same structure: `models.py`, `serializers.py`, `views.py`, and `urls.py`. Common permissions are stored in the main `celebrateit_api/permissions.py`.

### 5.3 Frontend Component Structure

#### Refactoring & Naming Decisions

- **Backend Naming: Recognition vs. Nomination**

At the beginning of development, the term **“post”** was used in the backend to represent a **recognition** entry. This naming choice made sense during the early phases, especially given the social-media style feed, but as the project grew to include **nominations** as a distinct content type, this naming led to confusion.

In hindsight:

- The model representing a recognition story should have been named `Recognition` instead of `Post`.
- The use of `post` throughout serializers, views, and URLs became semantically ambiguous once nominations were introduced.
- This naming limitation was preserved to avoid heavy refactoring and potential migration issues close to the project deadline.

Despite the naming mismatch, internal consistency was maintained, and the API functionality remained clear and testable.

- **Frontend Refactor: From Shared Logic to Dedicated Components**

The frontend originally aimed to reuse as many components as possible by treating both **recognitions** and **nominations** under a shared structure. However, the visual and behavioral differences between these two types gradually made this strategy unsustainable.

#### Key Challenges:

- **Component Naming Confusion**: Because recognitions were tied to the `Post` model, the frontend component that handled recognitions was also named `Post`. Meanwhile, a generic shared component also used the name `Post`, leading to frequent confusion during development.
- **Layout Divergence**: Recognitions contain optional images, likes, and comments, while nominations include unique elements like nominee name and tag (with styling).
- **Conditional Logic Overload**: `PostCard` initially handled both types through conditional rendering, which became hard to maintain and error-prone.

#### Refactor Strategy & Results

To address these issues, a structured refactor was implemented:

| Component         | Purpose                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PostLayoutShell` | Shared structural wrapper for both types (title, content, header, etc.) |
| `PostHeader`      | Extracted component for avatar, name, timestamp, and dropdown menu      |
| `PostCard`        | Focused solely on recognitions, includes image, like/comment logic      |
| `NominationCard`  | Handles nominations; renders nominee + tag via `extraContent` prop      |

This refactor provided:

- Clear separation of concerns between recognitions and nominations
- Better maintainability and scalability for future features
- Improved readability of both JSX and CSS modules

### 6.2 Front-End Application Testing

All manual testing was performed on the deployed frontend using a real user account. Each user story was tested with expected interactions and outcomes, covering both positive and negative cases.

Testing included:

- Auth flows (register, login, logout)
- Recognition and nomination CRUD
- Feed behaviour and toggling
- Detail page rendering
- Like and comment functionality
- User profile views and editing
- Search bar and sidebar interactions

### 6.4 Bugs and Fixes

Profile Avatar Not Rendering:

- **Bug**: User avatars were not displaying in PostCards, NominationCards, or the profile header.
- **Cause**: The serializer output did not include the `profile_image` field, and the frontend components were not prepared to receive it.
- **Fix**: Added `profile_image` to the relevant serializers (Posts, Nominations, Profiles) and updated frontend components (`PostHeader`, `RecognitionCard`, `NominationCard`) to fetch and display the image.

Auth State Not Syncing After Login/Logout:

- **Bug**: After logging in or out, the UI would occasionally show outdated user info or delay updates in the navbar and post ownership checks.
- **Cause**: The token handling logic didn’t consistently clean up or refresh the current user state across sessions.
- **Fix**: Improved the token timestamp logic (`removeTokenTimestamp`) and refined how the `CurrentUserContext` handles state during login/logout. The app now reliably reflects auth state throughout all pages.

Create Nomination – Dropdown Requires Double Click:

- **Bug**: In the nominee search field, clicking a user's name doesn't collapse the dropdown unless clicked twice.
- **Status**: Still unresolved.
- **Observation**:
- **Planned Fix**:

## 7. Deployment

This project was deployed as a **fullstack app** using **Heroku**, serving both the Django API and React frontend from a single Heroku app. The backend was deployed first, followed by the frontend build.

The live link can be found here: [CelebrateIt](https://celebrateit-866641373084.herokuapp.com/)

### 7.1 Backend Deployment (Initial Phase)

##### Tech Stack

- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (Heroku Postgres)
- Cloudinary (media hosting)

##### Steps:

1. **Set up PostgreSQL and Connect Heroku**

   - Create a Heroku app and attach a PostgreSQL database.
   - In Heroku Settings > Config Vars, add:

     - `DATABASE_URL` → provided by Heroku
     - `SECRET_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_URL`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CLIENT_ORIGIN`

   - Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install dj_database_url psycopg2 gunicorn 'django-cors-headers<4.6'
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Database Configuration in `settings.py`**

   - Add this at the top:

   ```python
   import dj_database_url
   import json
   ```

   - Replace `DATABASES` block:

   ```python
   if 'DEV' in os.environ:
         DATABASES = {
            'default': {
               'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
               'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
         }
   else:
         DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
         }
   ```

   - Update `ALLOWED_HOSTS`:

   ```python
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = json.loads(
         os.environ.get("ALLOWED_HOSTS", '["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]')
   )
   ```

3. **JWT Authentication and Permissions**

   - Add to `settings.py`:

   ```python
   REST_USE_JWT = True
   JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = 'my-app-auth'
   JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = 'my-refresh-token'
   JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'
   JWT_AUTH_SECURE = True
   ```

   - Add these apps to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

   ```python
   'dj_rest_auth',
   'dj_rest_auth.registration',
   'allauth',
   'allauth.account',
   'corsheaders',
   ```

   - And middleware:

   ```python
   'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
   ```

   - Set CORS:

   ```python
   CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
         origin for origin in [
            os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN'),
            os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV'),
         ] if origin
   ]
   CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True
   ```

4. **Prepare for Deployment**

   - Create `Procfile`:

   ```text
   release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
   web: gunicorn celebrateit_api.wsgi
   ```

   - Create `runtime.txt`:

   ```text
   python-3.10.11
   ```

   - In `settings.py`, replace hardcoded secret:

   ```python
   SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
   ```

5. **Database Setup**

   - Run in terminal:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Initial Deploy to Heroku**

   - Push to GitHub.
   - In Heroku > Deploy tab, connect your repo.
   - Click **Deploy Branch**.

The backend should now be live and ready to serve the frontend.

### 7.2 Frontend Deployment (Static Build Integration)

##### Tech Stack

- React
- WhiteNoise (for serving static files via Django)

1. **Install & configure WhiteNoise**

   ```bash
   pip install whitenoise==6.4.0
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

In `settings.py`:

- Add to `MIDDLEWARE`:

```python
'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
```

- Ensure this order in `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
'cloudinary_storage',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'cloudinary',
```

- Add:

```python
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
WHITENOISE_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles_build' / 'build'
```

2. **Build & move React app**

   - From `celebrateit_frontend/`:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   - From root project folder:

   ```bash
   rm -rf staticfiles_build/build
   mv celebrateit_frontend/build staticfiles_build/
   ```

3. **Update URLs and Axios**

   - In `urls.py`:

   ```python
   from django.views.generic import TemplateView

   urlpatterns = [
      path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')),
      path('api/', include('your_app.urls')),
   ]

   handler404 = TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')
   ```

   - In `axiosDefaults.js`:

   ```js
   axios.defaults.baseURL = "/api";
   ```

   - In `package.json`:

   ```json
   "proxy": "http://localhost:8000"
   ```

4. **Runtime & Requirements**

   - Create `runtime.txt` in the root:

   ```
   python-3.10.11
   ```

   - Ensure `psycopg2` is in requirements:

   ```
   psycopg2==2.9.9
   ```

### Heroku Config Vars (Final Fullstack)

| Key                     | Value                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS`         | `["your-app.herokuapp.com"]`     |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN`         | `https://your-app.herokuapp.com` |
| `DATABASE_URL`          | postgresql Provided by CI        |
| `SECRET_KEY`            | Django secret                    |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL`        | From Cloudinary dashboard        |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | `1` (optional during setup)      |

### Final Deployment Steps

1. Commit and push to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare fullstack app for Heroku deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. On Heroku → Deploy tab:

   - Select `main` branch
   - Click **Deploy Branch**

---

### Post-deployment Checks

- Visit `https://your-app.herokuapp.com/`
- Confirm React app loads and routes
- Confirm Django API at `/api/...`
- Test login, form submissions, image upload, etc.

### 7.3 Forking and Cloning

Forking the repository creates a copy of this project, allowing modifications without affecting the original code. Once the repository is forked, it can be cloned to a local machine for development.</br>
Follow these steps to fork, clone, and work on the project:

- **Fork the repository**

  - Go to the repository you want to fork on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  - In the top-right corner of the page, click `Fork`.
  - Name the new forked repository, then click `Create Fork`.
  - This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

- **Clone the forked repository**
  - In the forked repository on GitHub, above the list of files, click `Code`.
  - Copy the URL for the repository (either HTTPS or SSH).
  - Open a terminal (or Git Bash).
  - Type `git clone`, then paste the copied URL.
  - Press `Enter`.
  - Navigate to the newly cloned repository directory: `cd` and the repository name.

### 7.4 Security Considerations

- **Secrets and keys** were stored in environment variables and never committed to the repository.
- **.env** files were added to `.gitignore` to prevent leakage of credentials and config values.
- The application was deployed with `DEBUG = False` to ensure a secure production environment.
- Sensitive variables used include `SECRET_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_URL`, and database credentials.
- CORS was restricted via `CLIENT_ORIGIN` and `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` to allow only known origins.

These precautions were followed to prevent security vulnerabilities and meet best practices for cloud deployment.
